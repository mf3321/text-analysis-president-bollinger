This is a repository for an assignment for Gregory Eirich's graduate course Advanced Analytic Techniques, taken in Spring 2023 at Columbia University. The course TA was Xinge Zhang. The assignment was to compare a set of related texts.

I chose to compare the Commencement addresses of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-SD0VqeUvU">Lee C. Bollinger</a>, who served as president of Columbia University from 2002 to 2023. When I first completed this assignment, Bollinger was still a few months from stepping down and had yet to give his final address. My original analysis, reproduced in a <a href="https://mf3321.github.io/2023/04/21/Text-Analysis-President-Bollinger's-Commencement-Speeches-part-1.html">blog post</a>, was therefore on an "incomplete" set. However, the addition of the final addresss did not change any of the analysis in a meaningful way.

The files here are for the "full" set of addresses. Analysis included creating a word cloud, obtaining word frequencies, measuring sentiment subjectivity and polarity, and plotting sentiment as graphs. I plan to add topic modeling to this analysis soon.
